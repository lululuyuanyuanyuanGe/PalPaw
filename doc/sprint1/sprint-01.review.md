# **Project Name: PalPaw**

> _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
>      
> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## **Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect**

**When:** 2025/2/12  
**Where:** Online

---

## **Process - Reflection**

### **Decisions that turned out well**

1. **Choosing Expo and React Native as our development stack**  
   - Expo streamlined our setup process, allowing us to quickly bootstrap the project without extensive native configurations. 
   - React Native provided cross-platform compatibility, ensuring we can develop for both Android and iOS efficiently.

2. **Establishing a modular approach from the start**  
   - Dividing the app into four core modules (Posts, E-commerce, Wildlife, and User) helped structure our development and design thinking.
   - This early separation will allow different team members to focus on independent modules, improving workflow efficiency.

3. **Successfully setting up the frontend environment**  
   - Initializing the frontend development early gave us a head start on the UI/UX, allowing for a more iterative approach moving forward.
   - The basic layout structure was established, ensuring that the team has a shared vision of the app's design.

4. **Early layout planning for navigation and UI structure**  
   - Drafting the app's skeleton with placeholders for the four modules made it easier to visualize how screens interact.
   - It also allowed us to test navigation and ensure a smooth user experience.

### **Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped**

1. **Limited backend integration discussions**  
   - While frontend development was our main focus, we did not spend much time considering how data would be handled.
   - Future iterations should involve backend planning to avoid major rework later.

2. **No finalized UI/UX design before implementation**  
   - We jumped into coding without a finalized UI design, leading to some rework as we adjusted elements.
   - Moving forward, having wireframes or mockups before implementation will help reduce unnecessary revisions.

3. **Slow progress on component standardization**  
   - While we outlined core modules, we did not fully define reusable UI components.
   - This could lead to inconsistent designs if not addressed in the next iteration.

### **Planned changes**

1. **Incorporate backend planning earlier**  
   - Ensure database, API, and state management discussions happen in parallel with frontend development.

2. **Create wireframes before implementing UI components**  
   - Before coding new screens, design approval should be done to avoid back-and-forth adjustments.

3. **Define and document reusable UI components**  
   - Establish a shared design system or component library to ensure consistency across the app.

## **Product - Review**

### **Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:**

1. **Successfully initialized the React Native frontend environment using Expo**  
   - The development setup is now stable and ready for feature implementation.

2. **Structured the basic layout for the application**  
   - The four main modules (Posts, E-commerce, Wildlife, and User) were defined and added as navigable screens.

3. **Implemented initial navigation and routing between screens**  
   - The foundation for moving between different app sections was established using React Navigation.

### **Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:**

1. **Backend planning and API integration**  
   - We did not discuss or set up backend integration, which will be required for dynamic data handling in future sprints.

2. **Standardized UI components and styles**  
   - While we set up screens, we did not define a shared style guide or reusable component system.

3. **User authentication placeholder**  
   - The User module currently lacks authentication-related considerations, which should be addressed in upcoming iterations.

## **Meeting Highlights**

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. **We need to integrate backend discussions early**  
   - Understanding API requirements and data handling will prevent future rework and ensure smooth integration with the frontend.

2. **UI/UX design should be settled before implementation**  
   - Having proper wireframes or mockups will reduce unnecessary UI changes and inconsistencies.

3. **Component reusability should be prioritized**  
   - Defining a set of reusable UI components will improve maintainability and consistency across the app.

4. **Project structure is solid, but feature implementation is the next focus**  
   - Now that the development environment is ready, upcoming sprints should focus on adding functionality to each module.
